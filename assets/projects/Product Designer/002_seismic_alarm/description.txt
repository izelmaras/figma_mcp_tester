An iOS app that monitors environmental shakes and provides instant alerts to help users in earthquake-prone areas stay safe, especially during sleep when reaction time is slowest.

Challenge
• Help users monitor shakes in their environment while they sleep
• Address the gap in earthquake preparedness, especially during sleep when reaction time is slowest

Audience
• Residents in earthquake-prone areas, particularly Istanbul
• Heavy sleepers who need instant alerts
• Travelers staying in unfamiliar places
• People living in older, potentially unsafe buildings

Context
• 70% of buildings in Istanbul are not earthquake-resistant
• Many residents live in structures that fail to meet modern seismic standards
• Studies show that while people are aware of earthquake risks, preparedness remains low
• Need for instant motion alerts to help users stay aware of tremors

Solution
• Designed and built an iOS app to monitor environmental shakes
• Real-time motion visualization to help users understand movement
• Instant alerts that wake users if something happens
• Works whether users are asleep, traveling, or living in high-risk zones

Results
• Provides peace of mind for users in earthquake-prone areas
• Helps users understand exactly how much movement is happening around them
• Addresses critical safety gap in earthquake preparedness
