Roon Doctor Creator Tool

What
Help doctors effortlessly share their expertise in the quickest way possible.

Challenge
Roon is a two-sided platform where doctors create content and patients/caregivers consume it. We wanted to create a tool to scale our doctor creation process. The challenge was to develop a user-friendly tool that would fit seamlessly into the busy schedules of doctors, who often have limited tech knowledge and little time to learn new tools.

Problems to Solve
Product Issues
• Experts struggle to find time for answering questions.
• Need an efficient way to share knowledge without viewing others' responses.
• Want well-informed patient questions and a reliable referral resource.
• Aim to reach a broader audience and gain recognition without heavy social media use.
• Enjoy interaction with interviewers and addressing knowledge gaps.
• Need a user-friendly solution for recording answers.
• Roon's Q&A process is too time-consuming, limiting content scalability.

Usability Issues
• Riverside's interface is cumbersome and inefficient, leading to multiple re-recordings for satisfactory results.

Goals
• Double the number of questions recorded
• Conduct 80% of existing interviews on the app
• Increase the number of experts onboarded by 40%
• Increase unique profile shares from doctors by 20%

Solution
I designed a tool that allows for three modes of content creation: text, audio, and video. Additionally, I conceptualized a way to view all three content forms in the same view. The tool includes:
• A flow that allows experts to schedule a session
• When it's time for the session, experts get a notification
• Tapping notification opens the app, with curated questions that are assigned specifically to expert's background are shown in a stack
• Experts can skip or hit answer to record a video or audio answer
• Once session is complete, experts can leave the app or schedule a next session

Results
The feature is still in the process of being built, but early user research on the prototype has validated some key assumptions. Doctors expressed a preference for having a tool that is as easy to use as possible, offering the ability to create content in text, audio, and video formats, depending on the context and their location.
