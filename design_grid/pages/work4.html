        <h3>Discovery</h3>
        <p>
            We mapped user reactions to existing sound cues and identified gaps where audio
            reinforcement could reduce task completion ambiguity.

        <h3>Experiments</h3>
        <p>
            Paired spatial sound exploration with color and motion states to test impact on success
            metrics. Built a browser-based tuner so anyone could remix variations in real time.

        <h3>Outcome</h3>
        <p>
            New sound patterns increased shortcut adoption by 25% and surfaced an inclusive baseline
            for acoustic accessibility guidelines.
