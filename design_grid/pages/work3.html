        <h3>Context</h3>
        <p>
            Handoffs across time zones were blocked by outdated specs. We needed a source of truth
            engineered for rapid iteration and explicit versioning.

        <h3>Approach</h3>
        <p>
            Designed a documentation layer that paired interactive prototypes with auto-generated
            engineering notes. Each module mapped directly to component tokens and provided change
            history.

        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>
            Reduced back-and-forth comments by 60% and improved QA defect detection within staging
            builds during the first two sprints.
