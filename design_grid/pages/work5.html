        <h3>Challenge</h3>
        <p>
            Updating brand refresh work manually across iOS, Android, and web took weeks. We needed a
            unified token layer with governance built-in.

        <h3>System Architecture</h3>
        <p>
            Implemented a repo of source tokens that compile into platform-specific exports. Added
            versioned releases, visual diffs, and automated contrast validation.

        <h3>Impact</h3>
        <p>
            Hand-offs dropped from ~30 PRs to a single orchestrated release, and accessibility audits
            moved from quarterly to continuous.
