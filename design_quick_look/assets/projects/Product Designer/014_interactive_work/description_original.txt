Interactive Coded & 3D Work

As a creative coder and front-end developer, I create interactive experiences. I also enjoy 3D modeling, combining technical skills with artistic creativity to develop immersive projects.

Maras Filter
Context: Maras is an Instagram filter that superimposes line drawings onto the user's face when the selfie camera is activated. The challenge was to create an engaging and interactive filter that could stand out in Instagram's vast Effects gallery.
Solution: The filter comprises five line sketches overlaid on the user's face when the camera is directed towards it. Tapping on the screen toggles between the different sketches while opening the mouth causes the drawing to enlarge. A blur filter makes the user's face appear smoother. Built using Facebook's Spark AR, the Maras filter leverages my expertise in coding and interactive design to provide a playful and dynamic user experience.
Results: The Maras filter succeeded tremendously, ranking at the top of Instagram's Effects gallery under the selfies category and garnering millions of uses. Users from all over the country created artworks in tribute to the filter, including makeup and illustration.

Perceivable Interface
Context: The Perceivable Interface is a digital art project exploring human-technology interaction, inspired by Jacques Lacan's concept of the mirror stage
Solution: Using a full-body 3D motion capture sensor, I captured dancers' movements, which were then processed by customized software to create glitchy silhouettes on a large-scale projection. This project involved coding the motion capture processing and integrating multi-sensory elements such as stereo sound and lighting to create an immersive experience.

Verizon 5G Bus Experience
Context: I contributed to the creation of a coded animation for an immersive product design project. The goal was to visualize the future of 5G internet within a physical bus interior.
Solution: Collaborating with a team of technologists and product designers, I developed animations that brought the potential of 5G to life. This project showcased my ability to integrate coding with physical environments to create a holistic and immersive experience.

Easy Man
Context: An Easy Man was part of the first edition of Accessible Objects, an online platform for showcasing the works of independent emerging creators.
Solution: A virtual sculpture created using 3D modeling software.

TouchTunes Jukebox Music Visualization
Context: The TouchTunes Jukebox Music Visualizer project aimed to enhance the user experience by providing a visually captivating interaction that synchronized with the music being played.
Solution: Leveraging my design and coding skills, I created an immersive visual experience that dynamically responded to the rhythm and mood of the music. The visualizer incorporated various graphic elements, effects, and animations that enhanced user engagement.

Alike
Context: Alike is a wearable device project where I undertook a multi-faceted role, handling interface design, user experience mapping, technology coding, 3D printing, and soldering tech components.
Solution: I meticulously crafted the interface to ensure a seamless and intuitive user experience while simultaneously coding the underlying technology to bring the device's functionalities to life. The project culminated in creating informative infographics to demonstrate the device's capabilities.
