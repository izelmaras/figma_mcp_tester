Desen

Challenge
The challenge was to create a sustainable fashion brand that blends traditional Turkish craftsmanship with modern technology, specifically artificial intelligence (AI). The goal was to honor the rich cultural heritage of Turkish patterns while innovating the design process through AI.

Audience
Desen's target audience includes fashion enthusiasts who appreciate sustainable and unique designs, as well as those interested in the mix of traditional craftsmanship and new technology.

Context
Desen is rooted in our deep connection to Turkish culture, which is reflected in the brand name. 'Desen,' meaning 'pattern' in Turkish, signifies the intricate and beautiful patterns that inspire our designs. Our aim was to incorporate the rich colors and geometric shapes of Turkish visual history into modern fashion pieces.

Solution
We co-founded Desen as a family business to explore the intersection of tradition and technology. By utilizing AI, we generate infinite patterns and designs, ensuring each creation is uniquely Desen. Our designs are inspired by the timeless allure of Turkish craftsmanship, Bauhaus design language, and Turkish visual history. This blend allows us to create unique, crocheted fashion pieces that pay homage to the past while embracing future possibilities.

Result
Since our launch, Desen has gained significant attention in the Turkish design community. In 2023, Turkish GQ magazine featured the brand in a special photoshoot, highlighting our innovative approach and unique designs. We are currently preparing a collection to be sold at Sabah Dealer's Soho and Amagansett stores. This recognition and expansion reflect our successful blend of tradition and innovation, resonating with both the design community and fashion enthusiasts.
