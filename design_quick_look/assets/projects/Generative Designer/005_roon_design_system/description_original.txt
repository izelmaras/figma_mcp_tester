Solution
I developed Roon's design system using Brad Frost's Atomic Design Framework, creating a user-friendly and responsive system that meets diverse audience needs, including accessibility requirements. The design system supports continuous expansion of health conditions, allowing us to launch new conditions every other month. Key highlights include:
• Custom icons
• Accessible color and type systems
• Figma's auto-layout and variant compatibility
• A comprehensive collection of symbols, templates, and pages
• Light mode for better visibility and usability
• Custom illustrations and animations

This scalable system works across iOS, mobile, and desktop web, leveraging Figma's auto-layout capability. By implementing this design system, we efficiently created and iterated on various features, ensuring a consistent and coherent user experience.

Results
Thanks to the robust design system, I was able to design and implement numerous features as a single designer with only occasional freelance help. This efficiency enabled us to rapidly iterate and enhance the platform. The design system and new features have significantly improved the user experience, providing quick access to medically vetted information and catering to users' diverse needs and preferences.
