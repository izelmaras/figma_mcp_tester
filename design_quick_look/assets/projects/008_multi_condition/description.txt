Roon Multi-Condition

Challenge
• Many questions overlap across conditions, but Roon serves each condition individually
• Users want to access information for multiple conditions
• No easy way to access multiple conditions without logging in with different accounts
• Tedious log-out and log-in process

Audience
• Users who want to use Roon for more than one condition
• Patients and caregivers managing multiple health conditions

Context
• Roon currently serves four conditions: Glioblastoma, ALS, Dementia, Fertility
• Each user signed up for specific condition
• Some questions are shared across conditions (e.g., "How to be a good caregiver?" applies to both Cancer and Dementia)
• "What is Chemo?" relevant to various cancer types
• Overlap presents opportunity to merge knowledge base

Solution
• Explored solution consolidating all conditions into one platform
• Advanced and emotional filtering system allowing users to select:
  - Their condition
  - Journey stage
  - Content preference
  - Emotional needs related to information they seek
• For scope of project, decided to keep conditions separate in near term while making it easier to access multiple conditions

Results
• Eliminated tedious log-out and log-in process
• Made it easier for users to access multiple conditions
• Foundation for future knowledge base merging
